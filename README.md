# Pokedex Web Application

The scope of this project is to provide a model for people participating in a React online course (part of FIIPractic project, Iasi, Romania). I have organised this course together with a [colleague](https://github.com/stefanT9) of mine. 

Each week we expanded the scope of this pokedex, starting from simple, visual components and going thorugh routing, state management, data fetching and everything else we thought is needed for a beginner in web development. 

## Deployed app

### How to run

In order to run this project locally, it's enough to clone it and run `npm install` + `npm start` then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Tech Stack

I used React with Chakra UI for the interface, Framer Motion for animations and Recoil for state management. All data displayed is fetched from [PokeAPI](pokeapi.co/).
