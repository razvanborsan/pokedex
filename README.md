# Pokedex Web Application

The scope of this project is to provide a model for people taking part in a React online course (FIIPractic Iasi, Romania) on what's expected from their work. I am organising this course together with a [colleague](https://github.com/stefanT9) of mine. Each week we will expand the scope of this pokedex, starting from simple, visual components and going thorugh routing, data fetching, responsiveness and everything needed to become a potent web developer. We want to encourage people to learn by practicing and building a React portfolio.
